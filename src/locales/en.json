          "instructions": [
            "Prepare the Meat: Cut pork meat into 2cm pieces (if not using ribs). Place the meat or ribs in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Simmer for 1-1.5 hours until tender. If using meat with bone, remove the bones after boiling.",
            "Prepare Vegetables: While the meat is cooking, peel and prepare the vegetables. Grate half of the beets and cut the other half into thin strips. Cut the potatoes into large chunks. Finely chop the onion. Grate half of the carrot and cut the remaining half into thin strips. Thinly slice the cabbage.",
            "Cook the 'Zazharka' (Fry-up): Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and fry until golden. Add the carrots and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the beets and continue to fry. After about 10 minutes, stir in the tomato paste, sugar, and vinegar. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
            "Combine the Soup: Add the potatoes directly to the pot with the boiling meat. Add the entire beet and carrot 'zazharka' mixture to the pot. Add the sliced cabbage to the soup.",
            "Simmer: Bring the soup to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer gently for about 40 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.",
            "Finish and Serve: Turn off the heat. Stir in the fresh chopped parsley, salt, and pepper to your liking. For the best taste, let it rest for at least 20-30 minutes before serving."

          "servingSuggestion": "Serve hot with a side of black bread, fresh garlic cloves for rubbing on the bread, and chopped spring onions. Most importantly, add a generous dollop of sour cream or Greek yogurt to each bowl.",
